# WCAA Notable World Class Profiles (Athletes & Artists)

This project showcases the **Notable World Class Athletes & Artists (WCAA)** profiles through a dynamic, story-driven interface.  
It powers the experience published at:  
ðŸ‘‰ [Notable Artists & Athletes Discovery](https://theismaili.shorthandstories.com/notable-artists-and-athletes-discovery/)

## Overview

The system was designed to **collect, organize, and present** profiles of exceptional athletes and artists from the Ismaili community in an accessible, visually engaging way.  

Using a two-page template â€” **Grid Page** (discovery view) and **Inside Page** (individual profiles) â€” the content dynamically populates from Airtable data, making updates seamless for organizers and editors.

## Features

### 1. Airtable Integration

### 2. Grid Page
- Template-based layout to display all profiles in a visual grid.
- Each card dynamically populates with:
  - Profile image
  - Name
  - Discipline / role
- Clicking a card opens the corresponding **inside page**.

**Example:**
